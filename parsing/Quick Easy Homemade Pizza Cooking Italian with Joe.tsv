30	yes the good life lets you hide all the
4770	sadness you feel
10250	you own everybody welcome back to my
13730	kitchen cooking your town with Joe today
15799	we are making pizza so I got my flipper
18849	authentic Italian pizza flipper you
21800	don't need one of these but awesome um
23330	and we're going to make pizza margherita
25310	so let me throw my little prop over on
27080	the side Pizza Margherita I thought what
29150	I do with you guys today is show you how
30920	to make it right from start to finish
33230	I'm going to make a homemade dough
34760	homemade dough is always the best
36430	ideally if you're doing a homemade dough
38900	a day is really nice it's really a two
42410	day process because you want the dough
43730	to set for a day in the refrigerator and
46700	what that does is allow the allows the
49100	yeast the enzymes to break down gives
50660	the gives the dough a little bit better
52340	flavor but that's alright if you don't
53570	if now you're going to need about 3-4
55280	hours to let the dough to rise and then
57260	spread it on the sheet so either way is
58670	good so what do I have here as far as
60860	ingredients go so we've got 5 cups of
62930	flour oh we talked about this before any
65330	time you're making um I would say any
67190	bread any dough
68119	you want to use unbleached non enriched
71330	flour organic flour if possible ok so
73460	that's what we have here we have 5 5
75590	cups of flour which is great great we
78140	got 1/2 of a cup of olive oil we've got
80600	one and a half tablespoons of sugar
83510	we've got one tablespoon of salt we have
87830	2 cups of warm water I get a lot of
90920	emails on that when we talk about water
92330	and yeast and so forth you don't want
93619	water cold because it won't activate the
96110	yeast if you have it too hot or hot you
98750	know water we can't stick your hold your
101060	finger under the water it's going to
102710	it's going to kill these so what we want
104390	is essentially warm water we're going to
106460	take two packets of yeast and a little
109280	bit of Italian vino
110900	ok and I'm going to show you why it's
112220	kind of a nice little trick so that
113990	being said we want to activate the yeast
116030	so rule number one anytime you're making
117500	Brad or any type of dough you're going
120229	to activate the yeast what you're going
122090	to do is you're going to put the yeast
123229	in the warm water and and I love that
127610	smell you can smell that you know in
130250	bread
131000	or any type of beer or ain't a book Joe
135650	and then remember yeast life to eat
137959	sugars so in the in the goal there we
140780	want to take our sugar
142220	and we want to mix our sugar right in
143900	the water okay
146200	and you don't want to put salt in there
148820	because it can kill the yeast you don't
150410	want to put alcohol in there right now
151820	because they can kill the yeast you want
153710	to activate the yeast so we got two
156230	packets of yeast we're going to stir it
159020	around you're gonna let it set about
160460	five minutes and what that'll do is
163100	that'll start to activate okay that
164630	being said now we've got our salt and
166910	then five cups of our so 1 tablespoon of
168980	salt with our flour we're going to put
171140	that in there we've got 1/2 of a cup of
173930	olive oil nice good quality olive oil is
177680	what you want we're going to mix that in
179990	there set that off to the side and then
184250	what we're going to do is we're going to
185120	put a quarter cup of white wine now the
187940	reason we want to use a white wine and
190730	alcohol if you will and you'll see that
193460	in some dough's is the alcohol actually
195800	helps break down some of the glutens
197990	what will happen a lot of times when you
199430	work at oh is it builds up those
201380	proteins that we talked about and it
203990	makes the dough harder to work so a nice
207050	little trick you'll see that in some
208489	dough's for example it's it's
210290	traditional to use our Marcella line in
212750	in a cannoli and a cannoli shell dough
215630	the reason being is it makes it a lot
217610	easier to work with you're going to
220040	build up a lot of protein you're going
221480	to build up a lot of gluten so in this
222620	case we're going to use a little bit
223700	alcohol it's a nice little trick and
225950	then what I'll do is it'll allow the
227600	dough to build up the gluten so it will
229970	give you a good foundation but it will
231890	always make it easy you know when you
233360	take pizza dough sometimes you try to
234709	stretch it and it becomes elastic and it
236870	comes back that's the gluten within it
239060	so once it's room temperature if it's
240620	tough to get elastic it's usually
242840	because it's got a lot of gluten
244130	sometimes the dough's gotten tough
245540	you've overworked it this is kind of
247400	that little forgiving so we're going to
248600	use about 1/4 cup of wine maybe a little
252410	bit more but that's okay
253820	you can never put too much wine and I'm
256220	going to set that off to the side and
258850	then we've got this going so you can see
261560	it right now it's starting to foam up
263110	which is perfect so what I'm going to do
267440	is I'm going to mix this up a little bit
270650	and this is just going to make this is
273289	going to make a mess essentially okay
275279	so I've got a flat bottom wooden tool
279149	that I can use to scrape in the bowl
281699	right which makes it kind of fun and
283979	then I always have a baker's knife baker
286739	scraper which are nice you can get a
288659	plastic or what-have-you
289859	all right and I got my yeast going and
292499	you can see it foamy and it's starting
294449	to as I said it's certainly giving me
296519	that traditional cement smell and then
299249	I'm just going to put a little hole in
300359	the bottom so I put a little hole in
301649	there you're going to make kind of like
303059	a well so you put a well in there and
305999	then you just pour the we're two liquid
309029	right in there and that just gets it
312149	inside and then real simple you're going
315209	to start to mix it and as you mix it you
320299	can sing a little low
322799	law you can sing a little Sinatra you
325139	can get flour all over you it usually
328169	takes me two to three minutes into the
330119	mixing process before you get covered
331679	with flour it's almost always well this
333719	dough is going to be a little bit wetter
335719	this one might be a little bit oh that's
338639	beautiful
339229	hey and you're just going to mix it and
344009	just keep mixing and what will happen is
346919	it as it makes that mess see how it's
349259	starting to mix up really nice it's
351659	going to start to form a job so like I
355139	talked a little bit about the gluten
356879	it's actually going to start to form a
359549	foundation like a ball okay and that's a
362999	good thing and you can feel it how it's
365610	kind of warm see that's almost perfect
367799	so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
368999	take my scraper and I'm going to scrape
372119	off my tool I love my baker scrape right
375269	so we're pretty much done with my might
378029	old now I want to empty this out on my
380639	work surface and want to take a little
383429	bit of flour now let's just put that
386189	over the top of the work surface okay
387989	take a little flour that we won't stick
389669	and I'm going to take this and it
391289	doesn't even appear to be that sticky
392639	right now I'm gonna put on I love making
396629	Brad's I love making dough's once you
399599	start to get the knack it becomes a lot
403110	easier they become a lot more fun now I
406619	will tell you on a pizza dough we
409139	got a couple of challenges one we don't
411449	want to mix it too much we don't want to
413340	knead the dough too much because what's
415199	going to start to happen is it's going
417419	to get too tough now this is a little
420509	bit I can tell just by touching it it's
423449	just a little bit of a wet dough so I'm
425789	going to need to add a little bit more
427050	flour that's okay and when I say that
429240	when you touch it you can actually feel
430710	moisture and it almost becomes a little
432719	bit too tacky so let me let me mix it a
436169	little bit and then what you're going to
437939	do after you after you work the dough
439919	and I wouldn't work with more than five
441449	minutes is you're going to you're going
444120	to let the dough rest you constantly
445830	hear that you want to let the dough rest
447750	why because you're building up these
449520	bands of elastin and these bands of
452060	gluten which are very elastic and what
456000	happens is it starts to get tough to
459180	work with secondly we want a nice light
462120	like a Napoleon type of like Napoli
465810	right what's known as your traditional
468509	pizza thin crust pizza okay so that
471389	being said when when you bite into the
473909	the dough or if you will the crust you
476550	want the crust to be crunchy and light
480080	you don't want it to be chewy if you
483839	will so and the other challenge you'll
487050	always have when you're making a pizza
489659	in a house is you know you have to
492089	remember when you go to those wood
493349	burning pizza ovens especially like in
495960	Italy and Napoli and so forth those
497879	ovens are 800 degrees or hot so you know
501569	a traditional home oven 500 degrees by
505139	50 if you're lucky
506689	see that's starting to get nice now so
508830	what's going to happen is you know it's
511319	not going to it's not going to cook
512940	really sharp will crisp if you have to
515039	almost cook it a little bit longer and
517079	what you risk there why it's always
518940	tougher to get that same feel at home is
520860	because it starts to cook out some of
523589	the moisture in the dough so that's
526470	what's nice about a real hot um and when
528269	you pop it in there it cooks it almost
530190	flaps cooks it quick without cooking all
533519	the moisture out of the dough so in the
536519	house it's a little tougher so you're
537660	always going to want a pizza stone
538949	because you want to get as much
541010	hot surfaces possible contact with the
543230	dough the other challenge is because
545329	it's going to cook for maybe five or six
546949	minutes longer because in those ovens at
549680	800 degrees you're only going to cook at
550970	five minutes six minutes in this case we
553430	might leave it in there for 15 minutes
555199	so that being said you don't always want
558050	to put all your ingredients on the on
559730	the top so you might want to put it in
562490	the oven cook it with the tomato on
565010	there for let's say five minutes to
569600	seven minutes and then pull it out put
572360	some toppings on there and then put it
574370	back in because what that'll do is
575720	that'll allow this is getting really
577339	nice now that'll allow everything to
579380	cook and you won't burn it or crisp up
581240	off some of the toppings that you put on
583459	top and won't ruin the top make it look
586010	beautiful song yeah so that's that's
587930	essentially perfect right now it's just
590240	on the edge of of being a little bit
592610	tacky but that's fine and now what we
595100	want the dough to do is we want the
596540	dough to rise so I'm just going to clean
598850	up my counter here and then this little
600230	trick gets all your flour so see how
603680	beautiful that is it's got a beautiful
606050	smell to it I'm going to show you don't
609889	taste too sure you taste maybe a little
612139	bit of the salt a little bit of the oil
614839	a little bit of the flour which is
616670	beautiful now what this does is this is
618589	active yeast which was mixed with the
621260	sugar and they're going to eat the
623269	sugars which will get them really
624470	Rocking and then what it does is it
626449	starts to eat the carbohydrates of the
628550	flour what that's going to make
630199	essentially is two things it gives off a
631639	gas which is carbon dioxide and it gives
633350	off ethanol which is like alcohol right
635540	so it creates bubbles within it and it
639380	creates those flavors and then those
641569	enzymes break down those as I said some
643519	of those carbohydrates and it gives the
645260	crust a beautiful flavor so we're going
647180	to let this rest now until it doubles in
648889	size room temperature probably about two
651500	hours so I'm going to put it in this
652760	container here alright and what I'm
656060	going to do is I'm going to put just a
658699	little drizzle of olive oil in there is
661370	all you got to do put a little bit in
662720	the bottom okay and then what we're
664880	going to do is take the dough and we're
667190	just going to work it around and just
671390	work it so the top
673140	and bottom are covered with oil all
675899	right
676820	and that will keep it from building a
679260	skin or drying out okay and then just
681420	take a note of it you know hey okay it's
683279	taken about half of that in there right
685380	so that's got about half the space I'm
687089	going to put a top over at all right
689459	and I'll keep it warm keep the gasses
691950	inside there and then I'm going to set
693899	it off to the side we're going to let
695220	that set like I said for two hours
697560	what'll happen is two hours to three
699810	hours tops that will double or more in
703410	size which is great then we want to
705060	spread it if you're going to make it
706500	that day it'll be very easy because we
708420	put the wine in the in the flour to
710190	remember right that's a nice little
711329	trick so you put it and spread it out on
714690	a in a shape which you can put right on
717720	you're right on your pizza flipper if
720000	you will right you can put a cornmeal on
722100	there so it slips on and off the reason
724320	you'll see a lot of people use the
725640	cornmeal is because flour will burn so
728790	it'll give it a burnt flavor and you
730410	don't want to do that so it's a nice
731880	little trick you don't always need to do
733110	that and then you can slide it off it'll
735600	it'll get right on your pizza stone you
737220	want your pizza stone in your oven and
739170	you want that sucker hot I would start
740760	it for a good hour it's going to take a
742800	while for though I'm going to get that
743820	hot and you'll spread it out you're
746010	going to let it rise for fifteen or
747300	twenty minutes put your toppings on
748890	there we're going to put it in the oven
750269	cook it for like I said for seven
752070	minutes or so pull it out put a few
754110	other toppings on top put it back in let
756029	it cook for a little bit longer only got
757920	it's going to be unbelievable nice and
759329	easy so we're going to let this set I'll
760980	talk to you guys in a few minutes okay
762680	guys welcome back it's been three hours
764940	so just to give you an idea when we talk
768089	about something double in size look how
769949	awesome that isn't that awesome
771420	so the the yeast all right work right so
776240	that is that's a double in size and
780149	that's naked that's making carbon
782760	dioxide and ethanol so when something
784380	when you hear about things fermenting
785820	that's what it's making it and that's
788160	what you can smell on a few guys with
790290	pizza dough oh that's absolutely perfect
795240	just literally best I've ever made
798300	unbelievable
799170	educate Asia it smells so here's our
802470	dough so I'm going to put that out on
803699	the table
804870	coming up we get probably three decent
807960	sized pizzas or you can make some
809790	personal pizzas so we're going to try to
811680	make three decent sized pizzas I'll show
813240	you how to make one okay so I got that
814980	going it just adds up we're going to
817440	take some flour as I said I'm gonna
820170	spread it on the work surface but
822150	getting into our sauce real simple sauce
826020	is what I did today you can you can go
828030	with a cross you can make your own fresh
830490	crush I took a chato a puree tomato so
834720	it's what I did here I put salt
836730	I put pepper I put olive oil I put my
839610	Italian seasonings in there and I what I
841830	always do is heat up a little olive oil
843420	with garlic so I can get that flavor of
845430	garlic in there I put that in there
848090	oregano thyme basil and I mix that up
850770	and that's just a perfect sauce that
853230	we're going to use for the top of our
855960	pizza which is great so you can make
857700	something simple you can buy your own
858840	pizza sauce if you want I like to do
860760	that I get a little bit better control
861870	this is a buffalo mozzarella I'll tell
864930	you what I'm doing here is I'm straining
866190	it I put saran wrap over the top it's
868620	been straining about an hour - and you
871350	can see just that liquid why it's
874170	important to do that is because when you
875670	put certain cheese's ricotta cheese or
878190	whatever on top of anything or utilize
880680	it there's a lot of water in there and
882300	when you drain it you don't want the top
884310	of the pizza if you've ever had that
885630	experience where you can come out watery
886950	and leeks and make sure crust soggy you
889140	don't want to have it so so ideally what
891270	I did here is they drain that and the
893010	other thing I goes to to take note in is
895790	we want all of our ingredients to be
898320	room temperature you want all your
899820	ingredients to be room temperature that
901080	way we're not taking something that's
902250	room temperature put something cold on
904020	it you're going to cook at different
905570	temperatures that item you put on there
907710	that's cold now has to heat up and that
910190	sometimes it will make it
912000	obviously cook as well so I'm going to
913530	set these aside I just want to give you
914940	a heads up of what I was doing there and
917280	I got a little olive oil here that we're
918630	going to use in a minute and I'm just
919980	going to take my flour and I'm going to
922170	dust the top of my work surface here and
926490	when we get that going I'm gonna set
927720	that off to the
928570	right huh get all this out of the way
930070	here and now I got this beautiful look
933010	at that beautiful doe now I don't want
934150	to pound it down too much because I
936430	don't want to look at that see just
937840	coming right off is remember I put the
938950	olive oil under I don't want to kind of
940870	dump too much because I actually want to
942940	have some air inside the DOE and you see
947020	how nice and soft that is look how
949210	beautiful it is
950290	all right and see how it's nice and
952090	pliable remember we put that wine in
954070	there and what that's going to do is
955600	that's going to allow us to form the dog
960900	without oh that's just perfect
964030	okay so I want to cut it in three pieces
965620	okay so let's stand it's already kind of
967720	flat so we got one there let me do them
970900	because it's a little different there
972070	you go
972460	I got one there okay that'd be perfect
976000	okay so this will be nice to spread that
982030	perfect okay so what I'm going to do is
984820	I'm going to set one side here set the
986980	other one side I'm going to put a little
988690	flower sometimes you can use olive oil
991030	on a pan you can do whatever you want
993190	and I don't want to again I don't want
995620	to push it down too much
998950	you see how it's got that nice
1000200	elasticity to it look at that roll it up
1003390	underneath we're going to try to make it
1005670	round now I used to do this down the
1008130	restaurant with my dad and my father arm
1011400	and I'm not going to do it in here but
1013830	my dad easily can take that pizza dough
1016230	and and he can whip it right over the
1020160	top of his head so cool he's really good
1022980	at I'm okay at it my dad is really good
1025590	at it a lot of fun my father get mad at
1028200	me because I would do it a few times and
1029520	then you know you start whipping it you
1030960	don't wanna use your fingertips you want
1032040	to use the back your hand I search
1033360	spinning it and also you lose it boom
1035880	you know so you lose like three or four
1037500	of these things now you know our first
1039390	he's like okay you got to learn after
1040650	that it starts getting make sure beer
1042420	wasted time it buddy
1044010	so and you see how thin that is now this
1046650	is going to cook this is going to cook
1048780	quick so and look how easy that is ready
1051000	just do a nice little edge and if you
1054660	get a little too thin in the middle you
1055980	just push it back to God look how
1057960	perfect that is right
1059520	and you'll see that too when you when
1061050	you turn it sometimes it'll tear your
1063690	pizza is not shot so you can just it's
1066960	so this dough is so easy it's so
1069270	forgiving that you can push it right in
1071940	now I got a stone in there right and
1074670	what I like to do is just get my fingers
1077820	in there right of course some of that
1080250	extra see I'll get some
1081420	I got a dough there I like to just put a
1084270	little edge on it that edge will go down
1088490	and how hard is that
1090540	now we're your new is you're gonna let
1092309	this set we're gonna let this set for
1094380	about 15 minutes okay or longer for that
1096660	matter right so that's what I knew I'm
1098190	going to take this one over here alright
1101809	spread it across right I'm going to
1105210	piece that together see how that fell
1107520	apart and then I'm going to get my edge
1112910	ideally if you can what you tried to do
1115650	in the last one is just get your edge
1117690	going right and then once your edge goes
1120679	space it out I'm gonna tour a little bit
1124650	you just pinch it together hey beautiful
1128280	it's so fun to do stuff with your hands
1129960	too I know it's great
1132150	food always tastes better when you make
1133800	it yourself Saint Voltaire now this
1136920	one's coming out a little thicker which
1138840	is fine and then you just pull it now
1142590	you got your edge pull the dough stretch
1146580	it out don't look in there that's fine I
1149809	need my dad here to sing a little Dean
1153270	Martin and get going
1156210	good this is going to be great now what
1160200	we want to do is they said you want to
1161610	let it see it's so forgiving it's
1163440	elastic
1164270	but it's so oh that's a beautiful piece
1167309	of pie isn't it and that's true

1213559	um Louis out of the way I was going to
1218270	do all three of these but I'm having so
1219440	much fun what the hell so I got my mood
1224000	Sorella draining right I got basil leaf
1227080	what do you need you need a little salt
1229130	and pepper that's it little parmesan
1232850	which we're going to do freshly ground
1236260	if you will shredded so you got your
1242809	Neal politan but a Napoli and Napoli
1249830	what you're going to do is you're going
1252049	to take your pizza and you're going to
1253340	fold it a lot of times will fold it or
1255080	almost roll it and that's very common
1258789	and you'll see that in Rome and anywhere
1261230	else but when you talk about the pizza
1264350	from Napoli it's it's a thin crust you
1268340	know you get into that whole argument of
1270919	what's better Wow
1272029	they're both awesome in my opinion so so
1276440	again you just hit that edge right which
1279049	we had when we started one's a little
1281299	bigger than the other one that's perfect
1282970	beautiful let's stretch that baby out a
1285200	little bit gray hi how beautiful it is
1289220	perfect so I'm going to let these rest
1293080	for 15 minutes I got my little edge
1295520	going right and they're going to rise
1296990	this one's rising a little bit right now
1298429	alright because they're still active the
1299870	yeast is selected and then we'll let
1301610	these guys rise and I'll meet back with
1303740	you guys in a few minutes and then we're
1305870	going to spread them put them on the
1307370	tray slide them in their life is going
1310429	to be beautiful talk to you guys into
1312320	bed okay guys
1313789	rule number one don't wear a black shirt
1316010	you're cooking pizza with white flour
1317270	because it gets all richer so I think
1319310	we've got our dress looking good here so
1322370	let's go what I've got is I got the
1324590	stone I took my hot stone out so be
1327230	careful there's no forgiveness on an
1328820	oven that's 500 degrees just to give you
1330410	a heads up I'm going to put a little bit
1332360	of olive oil on the pizza what I like to
1336650	do and then just spread it with a spoon
1341020	well that smells good
1343010	nothing better than like bread and albo
1345680	right so you're going to put that across
1347570	that's just going to give it a nice
1348740	little flavor which is going to work
1351890	itself in to the dough and then what
1356720	we're going to do is we're going to take
1358880	our pizza sauce now again all I did is
1360500	tape I took Chantell pureed tomato sauce
1363920	okay or Chatto pureed pureed tomatoes is
1367430	what I'm trying to say and I'm just
1369110	going to spread that right over the top
1371780	okay and then you're just going to hit
1375170	it now I like to do that little lip on
1378110	the edge of the pizza if you remember
1380180	and that way it just gives you the guide
1381920	so the sauce your oil your cheese
1385280	everything doesn't work its way out I
1387980	like how the oil kind of mixes with the
1390740	sauce right there I love that it's all
1394370	going to mix itself or marry itself
1397040	together look a little bit of an
1399830	overflow that's perfect oh that smells
1403580	good too so I'm just going to spread
1405620	that right across perfect to set up
1409450	right now remember you know it's not
1412430	going to be as hot as you needed to be
1414350	to make that thin crust pizza so we
1416720	don't want to load the top full of
1418690	toppings because they're going to
1420170	they're going to overcook okay so we're
1421760	going to throw cheese okay guys so once
1423740	you're set what you're going to do is
1425150	you're going to take that stone that's
1426260	hot okay you're going to set it right in
1427820	the oven which is 500 degrees you're
1430520	going to get it all the way to the back
1431630	okay
1433550	close our up ready to go and then what
1436220	we're going to do is we're going to set
1437900	our timer about seven to ten minutes
1440060	okay and once we get our timer set very
1447620	important many of Pizza has been lost
1449720	because the timer has not been set I can
1451700	remember my father yelling many times in
1453890	different languages sometimes it's
1455810	English sometimes Italian and sometimes
1457640	languages I never understood when the
1459860	pigs food would hurt usually it'd be a
1461450	very brother so set the timer then we
1464090	don't forget about it we're going to get
1465260	it out about seven minutes we're going
1466670	to put our toppings on we're going to
1467720	put a pack in you don't want to cook it
1469370	more than you know that 15 minutes 16
1472040	minute because what starts to happen is
1473720	the moisture in the dough will start to
1476870	cook out and it starts to steam off and
1478520	the problem with that is the dose then
1480470	of it will often look normal
1483380	it'll look normal but it'll be really
1484580	dry almost like cardboard and it was
1486890	terrible so okay so I'll talk talk to
1489620	you guys a comment ready guys
1491480	all right this looks great great air
1494780	guitar but sometimes when you at home
1498110	when you flip it through there it
1499550	doesn't come off so what I'm going to do
1501590	is we've got that stone not oh my god
1505540	smell it's unbelievable remember no
1508460	forgiveness 500 degrees okay so when you
1510620	touch that you can always tell somebody
1512900	that cooked in the weekend when they got
1514130	that burn edge right so there is look at
1518210	that baby is that absolutely beautiful
1520640	so I'm going to put that right on my
1522410	granite
1524020	slide that puppy back in oh my gosh is
1530480	that
1531090	all across them come on over here look
1533580	at across look how perfect it is see
1536120	it's got that nice crunch to it on the
1538410	outside it's nice and loose right on the
1541350	stone it's absolutely perfect we got the
1543750	basil you got the Buffalo Muhtar I'll
1545640	see a bubble and you can actually see a
1546990	bubble in right there
1547890	absolutely beautiful song and when you
1550290	cut it you can tell see that nice crunch
1553160	now you know as I said before you don't
1555810	want to cook it longer because what
1559680	starts to happen is then it search to
1562770	dry the crust up you don't want to do
1564150	that the crust is perfect it's tender
1566370	right here on the edge of the crust but
