100800	participating now let's begin like I
103890	said at the beginning of this video I
105180	want to talk about gun jury and a few of
106890	the different reasons why I think they
108509	may have brought this character back
110070	into the main plot in my opinion I feel
112590	like they kept this character alive all
114600	these years for a reason Gendry has
116970	escaped death so many times throughout
118860	the course of this series it makes me
120540	believe he has a purpose to serve in the
122640	eighth and final season I actually want
125250	to go over some of the times he avoided
126960	death because it's easy to forget some
128910	of them and I am sure I will forget some
131010	instances myself but people have been
133560	trying to kill ginjury ever since season
135300	1 after his father King Robert Baratheon
137970	died Gendry had to flee King's Landing
140250	or else he would have been killed with
142200	all of Robert's other bastards
144209	luckily for Gendry his mentor topham
146970	aunt had a feeling this would happen so
149100	he made Gendry leave the shop or he was
151260	a blacksmith and this was one ginjury
153630	joined up with the Nights Watch and he
155610	was able to sneak out of the city with
157290	urine and Arya Stark that was
159780	technically the first time Gendry
161489	avoided death and his second time came
163530	shortly after that while he and Arya
165900	travelled to the wall the city watch
167549	came looking for Gentry again but at
169709	this time Gendry had no idea why he just
172739	knew it couldn't be for anything good
174269	but Joran risked his own life and made
176489	sure the city watch didn't take any of
178230	his recruits
179220	even though Joran was able to get the
181260	city watch to leave and only bought them
183090	a little bit of time
183959	because they had every intention of
185459	returning but this time they weren't
187319	going to leave without ginjury dead or
189329	alive
190019	sure enough the gold cloaks returned but
192510	this time they had Lannister men with
194489	them they pretty much killed yarn
196530	immediately which put ginjury in a very
198450	vulnerable position because he was his
200730	only real protection but thankfully Arya
203340	convinced them that law me was ginjury
205439	because ginjuries bullhead helmet was
207269	laying right next to his dead body but
209730	they still took Arya and Gendry as
211409	prisoners anyway ginjury may have
213629	escaped death again but now he was taken
215849	as a prisoner to Harrenhal and he wasn't
218400	at Harrenhal long before he almost died
220530	again
221159	Gendry was picked out of the crowd to be
223200	tortured by the tickler and he would
224819	have died but thankfully Tywin Lannister
226859	showed up and put an end to it because
228540	Tywin knew the prisoners could be put to
230400	good use of course this was when Arya
232829	became Tywin's cup bearer and ginjuries
235169	started making weapons for them and
236760	shortly after all of this this was when
239459	Aria had Jagan agar start to kill some
241980	of her enemies there and help them
244049	escape before they were all executed
246030	since Tywin left and could no longer
247769	protect them and Oreo was right because
250590	after jagan helps them escape sure
252900	enough everyone at Harrenhal was
254519	slaughtered after they escaped Harrenhal
256829	they eventually run into the Brotherhood
258840	without banners and this was when Gendry
260820	decided he was going to stay with them
262500	and make weapons at least that was until
265260	Melisandre showed up and took ginjury
267300	away because she wanted to use him as a
269039	sacrifice to help Stannis win the war
271199	and ultimately become the king of the
273419	Seven Kingdoms so as you can see Gendry
276150	was constantly on the verge of death and
278370	someone was constantly saving him from
280680	being killed even while he was with
282810	Melisandre she ended up using some of
284820	his blood but before she could do the
286650	ultimate sacrifice with him Davos helped
289470	him escape in the middle of the night by
291000	sending him off on a boat from
292349	Dragonstone Davos only gave him a little
295229	bit of food and water and Gendry did not
297090	know how to swim so for all we knew
299070	Gendry could have been dead he had
301320	disappeared for so many seasons it
303120	seemed like his story may be done but
305370	when you escaped death that many times
307199	you have to have some bigger purpose in
309330	terms of the endgame in the television
311759	show Gendry is the last living character
314310	with Baratheon blood and this makes him
316380	very important
317370	in my opinion in order to keep one of
319860	the major houses from going extinct they
322080	need Gendry and this is one of the many
323850	reasons why I think they brought him
325560	back in season seven Gendry makes his
328139	triumphant return and we learned that he
330210	was in King's Landing the entire time
332240	exactly where the people are that won
334650	him dead the most Joffrey may have been
337260	the one who ordered all of Roberts
338850	bastards to be killed but I still don't
340889	think Cersei would want Gendry running
342870	around with any kind of claim either
344490	even though he is a bastard but he can
347310	easily be legitimized which I think will
349560	happen before the series ends even after
352200	Gendry came back in season seven he
353880	could have been killed again north of
355380	the wall he may not have been up there
357479	for the main battle but they could have
358979	kept him there and killed his character
360840	off if they had no plans for him in the
363120	eighth season but once again
365160	Gendry survives another season and now
367350	that season 8 filming has begun you have
369510	to wonder what will they use Gendry for
371639	in the final six episodes ginjury has
374220	already been spotted in belfast this
376110	week so we will definitely see him in
378300	the next season but the question remains
380250	why why did they bring this minor
382500	character back is it just purely
384900	fanservice at this point because of how
386940	popular his rowing mean became or is
389700	there something more personally I think
391950	there are a few reasons and one of the
393810	more obvious reasons is because Gendry
395940	knows how to make weapons really well
404870	you're more than they can ever be
406900	they're just foot soldiers in a great
409510	you will make Kings rise
418110	we all know that the Great War is upon
420730	us especially now that the night king
422590	and his army are south of the wall
424140	luckily John was able to get enough
426250	dragonglass to equip the entire north
428560	with weapons and Gendry is the perfect
430930	candidate to help make those weapons out
432820	of dragonglass this was actually the
435130	main reason why Davos went the fine
437110	ginjury in King's Landing Davos told
439840	ginjury he was going to have him sent to
441430	Winterfell to make weapons but as we all
443440	know Gendry told John exactly who he was
445810	Gendry didn't just want to make weapons
447700	he wanted to go on the adventure north
449530	of the wall as well so he volunteered to
451630	go but now that the mission is over I
454030	can only assume
454960	Gendry will fulfill there are other
457030	needs which is making weapons something
459670	Gendry excels at doing there is also a
462280	good chance ginjury knows how to work
463870	with Valyrian steel now I know some
466150	people don't believe this to be true but
467950	I disagree
468700	gendry's mentor topo moth was one of the
471520	best blacksmiths in all of King's
473230	Landing and he learned how to reforge
475450	Valyrian steel when he was in volantis
477220	which is exactly where Melisandre is
479650	going in the books it was actually
481900	taught home aunt who reforged ice into
484270	what owes well and Oathkeeper for Tywin
486340	Lannister
487060	I think top Oman may have shown Gendry
489550	how to do this too even though there is
491500	no evidence of this yet but this could
493660	be a big reveal that they are saving for
495610	the a season you have to think george RR
498040	martin made Gendry a blacksmith for a
500260	specific reason and i don't think it's
502390	just a coincidence Gendry worked for the
504400	one man in King's Landing who knew how
506320	to rework Valyrian steel there must be
509020	another reason why those two worked
510580	together
511050	personally I think it would be amazing
513040	if Gendry meets some Valyrian steel
514840	weapons for the war I know they have
516970	plenty of dragonglass right now but
518890	let's be honest sword fights are so much
521200	cooler to watch using daggers sucks Plus
524650	Samwell Tarly took a bunch of books and
526540	documents from the Citadel when he left
528250	in the middle of the night perhaps the
530290	hidden method of making Valyrian steel
532060	was written on one of those pages Sam
533980	has with him Sam may discover the method
536830	or ingredients in Daenerys could provide
539110	her dragons fire and ginjury could be
541270	the blacksmith to make them this is one
543640	of the reasons they may have brought
544900	ginjury back in the next reason could be
547090	Gendry making some kind of marriage
548830	alliance or more specifically bring
551200	two houses together this is something
553720	Robert Baratheon always wanted the
555580	Starks and Baratheon's to join houses we
559600	were meant to rule together if your
562420	sister had lived would have been bound
564820	by blood well it's not too late I have a
570280	son you have a daughter well join our
574360	houses and as of right now the Starks
580690	have two good candidates with Sansa and
582850	Arya Sansa and Gendry are closer in age
585730	but Aria in ginjury already have a very
588190	strong relationship with one another the
590560	only problem is aria always said she did
592750	not want to settle down and become a
594160	lady she did not see herself getting
596170	married and having children but a lot of
598390	kids say things like that and now that
600340	aria is an adult and she has dealt with
602500	so much death maybe her outlook when
604750	this has changed
605860	if Aria and Gendry are still alive after
608230	the Great War ends she might be tired of
610420	running and fighting and who knows when
612280	she sees Gendry again Sparks might start
614590	the fly
615340	I think Oreo will be very happy to see
617530	him again there is something from the
619510	books that I want to read to you this
620950	was actually in the very first book a
622990	game of Thrones in one of Arya's very
625570	first chapters she is was septum
627490	ordained in Sansa and this is when they
629560	are sewing together septum ordained was
632320	going on and on about how well saunas
634450	work was and she says Songza has
636610	delicate hands but when septum or dane
639010	talks about arias hands she says aria
641620	has hands like a blacksmith I always
644170	thought this was interesting and it made
645700	me wonder if Aria and ginjury were meant
647770	to hook up at the end of the story but
649690	it might mean nothing I just figured I
651490	would mentioned that maybe Dan and Dave
653590	read that line too and thought they
655240	would have them hook up eventually who
656980	knows but that would be some crazy
658660	foreshadowing if it did happen because I
661300	believe that was written on the very
662890	first page of arias first chapter if I'm
665500	not mistaken
666400	even if Gendry doesn't marry a stark I
668800	still think he has a big purpose in the
670600	end which will most likely take place
672310	during the rebuilding phase of Westeros
674920	after the big wars are over in a new
677380	power structure is in place I think
679120	Kendra will be one of the remaining
680860	characters left who can help establish
682420	the new way of living
684730	and a new set of laws that will allow
686529	all Seven Kingdoms to be independent
688959	instead of ruled by one person sitting
691120	on an iron throne I don't think they
693490	will allow house Baratheon to go extinct
696010	at least I hope not
697300	someone will legitimize ginjury and give
699610	him a portion of land to have they must
702220	keep at least one person alive from each
704260	major house and they will be some of the
706180	people that can ensure Westeros can
708190	thrive and flourish again a lot of
710740	people are going to die in the last
712269	season and most of Westeros is going to
714190	be destroyed but there will be a group
715959	of people that survive and I believe
718360	ginjury will be one of those people this
720339	is ultimately why they brought him back
722019	for the final season Gendry will survive
724690	and make sure that spring is not only a
726790	dream but this is just my opinion let me
729430	know why you think injury is back and
731470	why he will be coming back for the a
733389	season do you think they have bigger
735459	plans for Gendry or do you think he will
737560	die either way let me know your thoughts
739420	down below I want to thank everyone for
741910	watching the video I do appreciate you
744040	taking a time out of your day I also
746230	want to thank everyone for their
747550	continued support on patreon it really
749680	means a lot to me and I cannot thank you
751510	enough I hope everyone has a great day
753819	and hopefully I will see you come back
755800	for the next one
