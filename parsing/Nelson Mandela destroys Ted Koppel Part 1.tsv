97560	don't do it ticket she needs to send
106050	someone down to the office we need to
136810	we spend in the seven years at the
141260	primary wire is a 20 and pirate
146450	correcting on those years that I have
149510	wasted prison tell me how are we doing
151670	on Eddie Murphy and on DeNiro
155300	Robin Williams in the rest the opening
157430	act is going to be the amico and the co
159200	renegade which we deal man
160940	the Tracy Chapman comes down with her
162590	band we're flying her in and then mr.
165140	Mandela does his speech
168100	we must pledge to continue our united
172100	Apple for they are polishing up on the
175610	apartheid system you can see the
181580	increase in the confetti and in the
183860	ticker tape coming out of the windows in
185420	here is Nelson Mandela
201090	and now Thursday June 21st Nelson
206560	Mandela comes to Harlem
208180	seven years ago while he was still in
210849	prison in South Africa Mandela was
213220	awarded an honorary doctorate in
215319	abstention at this university today he
218860	comes to the City College of New York in
221560	person to participate in a town meeting
228810	ladies and gentlemen Nelson Mandela
312410	look company for a Talmudic Nelson
315720	Mandela
319070	mr. Mandela you're participating in what
321810	is a very old and honorable American
323850	tradition the Town Meeting and rather
325530	than waste any time with my questions if
327450	they don't ask you good ones I promise I
329040	will try to but I think we have some
331080	people out here who have some
332310	provocative and perhaps even
333750	controversial questions to ask you and
336060	I'd like to begin mr. Mandela
337760	you've come to the United States of
340080	America other than South Africa probably
343500	the most racially divided country in the
346080	world evidence of that is right here in
349320	New York City we are one of the most
351780	racially divided cities in the world
354260	blood of our children stained the
356850	sidewalks of New York Howard Beach
359990	Bensonhurst Yusef Hawkins Michael
363390	Griffith our grandmothers Eleanor
365730	bumpers mothers Yvonne Smallwood do you
369270	think that this country given its racial
372630	record and current history can assume
375600	the real credible and moral leadership
378960	in the fight against a party because
382470	it's hypocrisy is well known and one
385350	wonders whether it can really do what we
388980	wanted to do and if it can what role can
392220	we as Africans in America player
402789	if I may just ask you for your
405969	indulgence if you'd be good enough there
409240	will be some questions you'll like
410620	there'll be some questions you won't
412029	like let me just ask you though to save
414099	the time so that we can listen to
415539	Mandela's answers mr. Mandela's answers
417550	mr. Mandela I have received yeah I do
424029	not know whether I am in a mood to think
427409	: I have been deeply touched by this
432939	warm welcome but the respondent of the
436870	question I must say that the ANC and
444300	infected the entire mass Democratic
446830	movement in South Africa condemns a
450879	racialism wherever it may be found we
455529	are fighting a special kind of racialism
458680	in our own country and we expect to all
462939	people who are the victims of racialism
466439	to fight that in but I am here and I am
474610	primarily concerned with what are the
478629	people of the u.s. ill and his organs of
484300	government are doing to promote the
489219	struggle against apartheid in our
491169	country and I must say to you that we
496419	have the support not only of the masses
501610	of the people we have the support of the
505180	Congress as well as the government and I
510159	think that it would not be proper for me
513300	to delve into the controversial issues
518159	which are tearing the society of this
521769	country apart I am sure that the USA has
528089	produced a committed leaders of all of
532180	all population groups who are able to
535420	and yeah enough is very effectively let
539560	me follow up if I may on part of your
541450	answer you say you're sure you have the
543130	support of the people the Congress and
544899	the leadership the by the leadership you
547269	also mean the President of the United
548709	States you satisfied that you have his
550570	support well I am sure of one thing that
556620	he condemns apartheid as I do that is
561820	enough for us to find fed a common room
566440	with a president and this is the message
569320	that I'm going to put to him when I met
571300	him and when you say you have the
573339	support of Congress are you satisfied
574930	that you have enough votes in Congress
576610	to keep sanctions oddly I cannot say
579550	that lies in the future but when I
583209	address Congress the main thrust of my
587320	speech is that the Congress to support
590290	sanctions why are you so insistent mr.
594430	Mandela and then we'll go to a question
595870	at this microphone over here why are you
598420	so insistent upon maintaining sanctions
600880	at a time when it can be argued that the
603339	South African government has made more
605079	concessions your release being only one
607269	of them then it has ever made in the
609550	past 40 years
610420	I stood no better about this matter mr.
614769	Cockerell than you
625920	after all it is the agency not the
632260	government that is responsible for the
635740	present talks we have been hammering the
639640	government since 1986 to meet us ended
644920	and in spite of the humility and
649260	insulting conditions they tried to
652570	impose on us before they could agree to
657090	meeting us we nevertheless had
660400	sufficient patience and sufficient
663610	commitment to peace as to continue
666910	hammering them to meet us they have
670630	eventually done so but despite the fact
673900	that the talks are now all a part it is
679510	still in place
681120	the police are still killing our people
684910	as they've done over the years vigilante
689380	groups are openly arming themselves for
694240	the specific purpose of attacking
697290	progressive groups and progressive
699730	leaders their right wing is also amended
704380	itself openly and they say they are
707740	doing so for the purpose of destroying
709870	the ANC they are calling for some of us
713470	to be held why would you think that you
716980	should now relax our strategies what has
720010	happened let's move on to the next
723880	question
725370	Almonte my name is Gloria toot I was
729250	born in Harlem
730210	I'm a lawyer I've lived here all my life
732420	I'm also on the board of directors of
735190	the African Educational Foundation it's
737290	raising money to train the people of
739570	Africa for industry I am concerned about
742330	the future economy of South Africa I am
746260	concerned when I look at the newer
748240	countries that gained their freedom so
750850	hard fort indeed did not demonstrate
754140	sound fiscal policy
756570	illiteracy is still quite large and
759090	hunger what and assure me as a human
763740	being and a concerned african-american
766170	that the ANC will indeed have a fiscal
770030	solvent policy that will continue the
773280	use of the resources of South Africa in
775710	a meaningful way or should I put it more
777660	succinctly will your economy be based on
780300	the Marxist system socialism or
783060	capitalism or both I knew that that was
788040	the question you wanted to ask
795700	I am happy that have had the courage to
799840	put it directly we are not concerned
807760	with models we are not concerned with
812380	leaders we are practical men and women
817080	whose solutions are dictated by the
819940	actual conditions existing in our
821800	country as somebody has said we do not
827680	care whether the cat is black or white
830290	as long as it can catch mice if I mean
839920	what we want what we want to achieve is
844680	a healthy and vibrant economy which can
851650	ensure full employment to our people
855630	maximum production and that the
858850	development of social justice we wanted
863050	to rectify the imbalances that exist in
866170	our economy one of the company's
870880	well-known companies in the country
872730	one company owes more than 75% of the
878410	shares quoted in each of our aspects to
881020	exchange this is illustrative of how our
885490	economy is organized it is moderating
889660	the resources of the country a
892620	monopolized by a white minority in in
898630	that minority by a few individuals
901380	whereas the masses of the people
903580	especially blacks and left the poor
908940	ridden with disease illiteracy without
914770	educational facilities we wanted to
918250	develop an economy which will put an end
920710	to that and will live to other people to
926140	put a label if they so wish mr. Mandela
928840	forgive me
932079	we have to take a short break we'll be
934850	we'll be just we'll be back in just a
936680	moment thank you
946590	the couple report a town meeting with
949540	Nelson Mandela from City College in New
951400	York continues and we're back once again
954760	and mr. Mandela as I told you before we
957250	began this broadcast almost all the
959380	questions will be coming here from the
960730	audience but we also went to a couple of
962530	people back in South Africa told them
964390	you were going to be on the broadcast
965440	and asked them if they had any questions
967930	for you or comments that they wanted to
969640	make to you one of those from whom we
972760	are about to hear now and I'd like you
974830	to address your attention over to that
977230	monitor as a man by the name of huallin
978760	de novo who's one of the leaders of the
980440	Conservative Party have a listen to what
982630	he has to say hello Nelson I'm a South
986590	African I'm an Afrikaner I want
990220	self-determination for my people in a
992770	part of South Africa you can't have the
996490	whole South Africa for yourself a part
999880	of it belongs to my people Nelson you're
1004620	not going to nationalize the assets of
1007710	the white people I have worked for my
1011130	banks my minds my businesses and my
1015210	farms you are not going to take it stop
1018240	your violence stop your sanction
1021120	campaign stop your nonsense
1023420	leave the violent campaign alone and
1028800	come and sit down
1029730	become a normal person and talk and
1032520	maybe that way we can find solutions and
1036110	lastly forget communism Nelson it's gone
1041839	and I hope he will be well I believe you
1045240	were ill I hope you will recover and
1047580	have a good journey
1052310	an phenomena scores a group fun heart a
1063560	a dot Enda at the Hollander it sacré on
1071210	that a deficit
1081250	well just interpret please what I said I
1085900	just wanted to demonstrate that I am
1089240	bilingual
1100290	all I have said to quest on the nether
1104880	is to say I am happy to know you I hope
1114580	that one day we shall have the
1116260	opportunity to discuss the affairs of
1120010	our country that is all now let me pick
1123190	up if I may mr. Mandela though on on
1125500	what coos mother mother had to say he
1128140	represents as you know a small but
1130900	significant segment of the white
1132580	population in South Africa which is
1135130	pressuring mr. de Klerk from that
1137980	political side of the spectrum to what
1140500	degree do you feel any need to help
1144340	president de Klerk deal with people like
1147520	whose mother no mr. de Klerk is an
1155350	independent resource a resourceful and
1161370	flexible leader he is able on his own to
1167680	deal with the right wing the outside
1171520	world will be making a grave mistake if
1177100	they think they can do anything
1179200	whatsoever to help mr. de Klerk as
1183910	against the right wing in fact for the
1189400	international community to seek to do
1192550	anything expressly to help mr. de Klerk
1196860	would be the best way of undermining him
1201420	because what the right wing is doing is
1205930	to tell the whites in South Africa that
1209640	de Klerk is a puppet of the United
1213070	States and Great Britain and that what
1217030	is doing now is precisely because he has
1221260	received instructions from those two
1224020	countries and if now the Western world
1227650	comes out to say they want to help the
1230890	track
1231730	that is what the right-wing exactly once
1235380	you will destroy him with the a and C
1239740	are the only people who can help him and
1245670	we are doing our very best to healthy
1248970	one of the points were put into him
1252040	is that a mr. de Klerk if he wants to
1257650	see the future non-racial South Africa
1261790	in it is to speed up in regard to the
1269560	negotiating process that in a year or
1273640	two he should be able to extend the vote
1276270	to all South Africans he must face a
1280240	thinking in terms of solutions by
1283600	sticking a Monday to two white only
1286380	he must place himself in a position
1289270	where he can get the support of the
1292630	overwhelming majority of the people of
1294820	South Africa and if he gives every men
1299020	and women whatever the color of his skin
1301890	their right to vote he will be in an
1306400	extremely strong position and there's
1309220	nothing that the right wing can do but
1312040	if he continues as he is doing at the
1314950	present moment still to think of racist
1318910	solutions solutions which are seen first
1323590	and foremost as protecting the rights of
1326380	the whites he will go under let us move
1329950	on to a next questioner at the
1331900	microphone over there mr. welcome to
1333340	America mr. Mandela I'm Ken Adelman
1335370	those of us who share your struggle for
1338320	human rights and against apartheid and
1340480	then somewhat disappointed by the models
1342790	of human rights that you have held up
1344650	since being released in jail
1346810	you've met over the last six months
1348460	three times with yes or Arafat who you
1351790	have praised you have told Qadhafi that
1355420	you share the view and applaud him on
1358540	his record of human rights and his drive
1360460	for freedom and peace around the world
1362500	and you have praised Fidel Castro
1365290	as a leader of human rights and said
1367210	that Cuba was one of the countries
1370660	that's head and shoulders above all
1372220	other countries and human rights despite
1374320	the fact that documents of the United
1376090	Nations and elsewhere show that cube is
1377800	one of the worst
1378490	I was just wondering are these your
1380920	models of leaders of human rights and if
1384070	so would you want a Qaddafi or an Arab
1386800	or a Castro to be a future president of
1389500	South Africa one of the mistakes which
1396070	has some political analysts make is to
1400870	think that they are enemies should be
1405100	our enemies
1428070	that we can and we will never do we have
1437860	our own struggles which were conducted
1442259	we are grateful to the world for
1446980	supporting our struggle but nevertheless
1450370	we are an independent organization with
1455080	its own policy and the attitude of every
1459309	country towards our attitude towards any
1463749	country is determined by the attitude of
1467110	that country to our struggle
1483350	yessuh elephant Colonel Gaddafi Fidel
1493230	Castro support our struggle to the hilt
1505310	there is no reason whatsoever why we
1510600	should have any hesitation about Haley
1515750	their commitment to human rights as they
1519570	are being demanded in South Africa our
1523410	attitude is based solely on the fact
1526590	that that they fully support the
1529410	anti-apartheid struggle they do not
1532290	support it only in rhetoric they are
1536040	placing resources
1548630	that is the position
1552859	mr. Mandela you've said a number of very
1556289	controversial things in that last
1557850	response and I'd like to come back to
1559830	some of them when we return but once
1561269	again we have to take a quick break
1562529	we'll be back the couple before we'll
1567840	continue and we're back once again with
1573600	Nelson Mandela at the City College of
1575249	New York mr. Mandela as I mentioned to
1577320	you before the program we also have some
1579059	distinguished guests sitting behind us
1581669	one of whom mr. Henry Sigmund together
1584850	with two other Jewish leaders came to
1587669	Geneva to visit with you precisely
1590249	because they were so concerned not only
1592919	by the kind of thing that you just said
1595919	before the break with regard to Yasser
1597690	Arafat with regard to Libya's Colonel
1600629	Qaddafi but also because of the support
1603720	that you seemed at different times to
1606480	give to the PLO I would like to ask mr.
1610080	Sigman to stand now for a moment and
1612690	pose whatever question he would like
1614549	directly to you mr. Sigman before I pose
1620429	my question permit me to say first that
1624929	when I had the pleasure and honor of
1627539	meeting with mr. Mandela in Geneva we
1631320	said to him and I would like to repeat
1632970	this now in order to put my question in
1635279	context that the commitment of the
1638159	Jewish organizations that met with him
1640139	to the struggle against apartheid
1643129	against racism against injustice in
1646590	South Africa is absolutely unconditional
1650509	it is not dependent on whether we are
1653820	happy or unhappy with responses that mr.
1657299	Mandela gives to some questions
1659239	having said that
1667660	having said that I think I would be
1670460	dishonest if I did not express profound
1673910	disappointment with the answer that mr.
1677030	Mandela gave to the previous question
1679270	because it suggests a certain degree of
1682340	a morality the that suggests that the
1690190	what these people do in their own
1692900	countries what a Qaddafi does in Libya
1695870	what it what a Castro does in Cuba is
1700970	totally irrelevant even in terms of the
1704030	issue of human rights as long as they
1708440	support the cause of the ANC I hope that
1712250	is not what mr. Mandela meant and I
1714890	would hope that he would clarify that
1717080	issue further mr. Mandela firstly we are
1725600	a liberation movement which is fully
1730100	involved in a struggle to emancipate our
1735140	people from one of the worst racial
1739610	tyrannies the world has seen we have no
1745640	time to be looking into the internal
1748400	affairs of other countries
1754810	it is unreasonable for anybody to think
1759860	that this is our room I have been asked
1764600	by somebody who wants me to express an
1768140	opinion on the differences that are
1771080	taking place within the USA and he has
1775100	made his position quite clear that there
1778580	is racialism in this country I have
1781910	refused to be brought into that
1792320	why should mr. Seidman accept my refusal
1797790	to be withdrawn into the internal
1800790	affairs of the United States and at the
1809370	same time want me to be involved in the
1813390	internal affairs of Libya and Cuba I
1819890	refuse to do that as far as Yasser
1824100	Arafat is concerned I explained to mr.
1827580	Sydney that we identified with the piano
1834140	because just like our sons they are
1839820	fighting for the right of
1841350	self-determination
1853960	I went further however to say that the
1858850	support for Yasser Arafat in his
1863049	struggle does not mean that the agency
1867059	has ever doubted the right of Israel to
1872549	exist as a state leader we have stood
1883059	quite open defending for the right of
1887409	that state to exist within secured
1889990	borders but of course as I said to mr.
1894730	signal in Geneva and others that we
1898960	carefully define what we mean by secure
1902529	borders we do not mean that Israel has
1908409	the right to retake the territories they
1912279	conquered from the Arab world like the
1915159	Gaza Strip the Golan Heights and at the
1919389	West Bank we don't agree with that those
1923919	territories should be returned to the
1926590	Arab people
1932440	mr. Mandela
1936730	I also explained to mr. Sigmund and
1941290	company that in our organization we have
1946840	Jews in fact mr. Gaddafi did not allow
1953799	us to open our offices in Libya
1957120	precisely because we had the courage to
1961450	say to him we work with the Jews in our
1965140	organization and he didn't allow us to
1968950	open an office until February this year
1971910	when he had to accept us as we are we
1976929	are not prepared to be saved by anybody
1979980	we have an independent policy which we
1984309	assert no matter with whom we discuss
1988049	mr. Mandela let's move on to our next
1990280	question
1993179	welcome my name is Malcolm Dunn I'm from
1996460	Plainfield New Jersey and I'm chairman
1998440	of the United minority Business Brain
2000299	Trust of New Jersey and a national
2002010	chairman of the American Legal Defense
2004530	Fund for the minority business
2007169	organizations I have a question that
2009720	relates to our participation in business
2012419	in this country we who have gained the
2015210	moxie and who have reached certain
2018140	levels of proficiency in business and
2020880	education in various professions we'd
2024179	like to know what can we offer what can
2029309	we who have been denied access total
2031830	absorption into the American system in
2033540	those professions what can we prepare
2036150	ourselves to offer to you in the
2038640	motherland
2039270	given your attainment of the one vote
2041640	one person one vote I asked this in the
2044730	context of Eastern European countries
2047700	being free and the money that was
2049859	formally sent to Africa is now being
2053580	diverted to those Eastern European
2055139	countries
2056040	I asked also in the context that though
2059250	our country has opened up its doors to
2061619	people of a lighter hue before they have
2063629	absorbed us fully in this country
2066290	and if you have an answer to my question
2069659	please let me know who I can contact
2071669	after this assemblage to keep up the
2073470	dialogue Thank You America of the USA
2083629	have a lot to offer the people of South
2089129	Africa in the course of their struggle
2093169	whatever disabilities you have in this
2096210	country at least you have been exposed
2103069	to opportunities which we don't have
2107150	you have better educational facilities
2111680	there is no legal caliber in this
2114690	country and therefore you have been able
2119130	to acquire in spite of your problems you
2123180	have been able to acquire expect
2128730	knowledge skills which will require
2133550	especially when during the poster
2138000	parties of South Africa you can help us
2141660	a great deal by making that expertise
2145170	available to us as far as the question
2149310	of who you can contact keep in contact
2152220	with in our country that we can discuss
2155240	after this ok all right we're going to
2157680	take another quick commercial break and
2159089	then we'll be back in a moment
2168040	the couple report a town meeting with
2170960	Nelson Mandela continues once again Ted
2173510	Koppel mr. Mandela as I mentioned to you
2175910	also before you came out here this
2178040	afternoon there are black leaders in
2181940	South Africa with whom you and your
2185180	organization have differences one of
2186920	them who represents many of the Zulu
2189350	people political organization known as
2191030	inkatha has got Roberto lazy if you'd be
2193430	good enough to direct your attention
2194360	once again to the monitor and listen to
2196370	what he has to say I know my dear that
2200480	you're not responsible for our not
2202160	getting together and I know that it's
2204080	other people that have said they've said
2205910	I'm not imagining it
2207050	they've said it in so many words that
2208580	they don't want you and I to get
2210080	together but Madiba all these years you
2213680	have been incarcerated you know we've
2215510	been in touch we all know that I've
2218750	always paid tribute to you that I've
2221510	refused you know to negotiate with any
2224210	of the white leaders in this country for
2225920	for four decades now because I told them
2229100	that it was an absolute non-negotiable
2231740	there are can't get to the conference
2233330	table without you and our brothers were
2236480	incarcerated with you and others and
2238850	before the unveiling of ANC
2240830	TAC and other organizations so I think
2244220	in your absence you might be interested
2247820	to know that one of our brothers who is
2250280	very close to you as being to see me he
2253160	will have a certain message for you when
2254540	you return and I said myself that it's
2257270	absolutely up to you because there is
2260060	nothing that prevents you even in the
2261560	United States to pick up a telephone and
2263900	and say hello and talk to me as we're
2266240	doing ever since you left change her
2271370	Sangha I do not think it correct for me
2282010	to wash our dirty linen
2286430	in a foreign country
2299500	I am hesitant to do that even though
2307510	here I have the feeling but I am among
2313930	our comrades-in-arms brothers and
2317050	sisters one thing I would like to dispel
2324720	with all the fuss at my command is that
2330250	there is no difference whatsoever
2332890	between myself and my organization on
2340960	the attitude towards in Qatar and
2345600	yourself in person if I have not seen
2354490	you it is because of decisions which we
2359140	have carefully discussed amongst
2360730	ourselves and of which I am part I
2367200	however would like her to repeat what
2372550	you know I have said on numerous
2376660	occasions I would like the a and C and
2384160	in Qatar to sit down and resolve our
2388780	problems and end the violence that is
2391990	going on today in the town but you know
2396520	as well as I do that the question is no
2400630	longer simple the government has taken
2405760	advantage of the differences between my
2409320	organization and your organization they
2413470	are using those differences for the
2416740	purpose of trying to eliminate the ANC
2420670	and what they consider to be members of
2427240	that organization who are a threat to
2430390	white supremacy
2432100	that now is our problem it is no longer
2435910	just a question of me meeting you I have
2439990	asked him mr. de Klerk this simple
2442480	question I have said to him you have a
2448120	strong efficient and well-equipped army
2453700	and police force can you tell me why the
2460090	government has failed to suppress
2464070	violence in which almost 4,000 lexer
2467740	continue mr. de Klerk has never been
2475540	able to give a satisfactory answer to my
2478480	question I have told you I've given him
2482080	the answer I have said to him you have
2486700	not suppressed this violence
2488560	deliberately because you believe that by
2494380	using these differences between these
2496480	two organizations you can crush your
2500350	enemy number one the a and C that is
2504820	your difficulty and I must repeat to you
2507480	that is the main problem facing the
2510580	people of South Africa it is the
2512890	involvement of the government and its
2515710	police in the violence that is taking
2518530	place did not talk we have mr. Mandela I
2523120	believe on microphone B over there a
2525850	former representative of the South
2527620	African government he was until very
2529300	recently the Consul General here in New
2531130	York would you like to come to the
2532210	microphone and pose your question that
2533590	is sir mr. Koppel mr. Mandela as one who
2537040	for a period of years has advocated your
2538930	unconditional release I want to say at
2541180	the outset I'm delighted to see you here
2543010	in New York
2543640	welcome secondly I also commend you for
2547840	your loyalty to your friends
2549370	controversial though that may be but in
2552670	framing my question in dealing with
2554350	ANATEL in particular I as a white South
2558010	African and most concerned about the
2561490	bloodletting the carnage that is going
2563680	on
2564650	and whilst I take the point that you've
2567740	made that the police possibly and
2570080	probably could do more I do believe that
2572870	the challenge or the ball is in your
2574580	court mr. Mandela because one cannot we
2578330	as South Africans cannot afford to have
2580880	South Africans killing South Africans
2583220	we've got to have peace harmony a strong
2586010	economy we've got to hold out our hands
2588230	to each other so we can build a new
2590150	South Africa with a minimum of
2592850	bitterness I believe sir that you are
2595820	the Statesman who can do it I would like
2598040	to do you to do it and I'd like you to
2600050	issue a call I'd like you to extend the
2602360	hand to chief gotcha brutal izzy
2604420	irrespective of political differences
2606640	irrespective of dirty linen irrespective
2609500	of what has gone before I believe you
2611720	owe it to each other and the country to
2613910	see that we have a stable secure
2615890	platform on which to go forward together
2618260	white black and brown I hope you agree I
2623470	do not consider your remarks as a
2626690	lecture to me
2634250	because because you would know that it
2640049	is the agency had not the government
2644839	that has compelled the government to sit
2648660	down and talk this with us
